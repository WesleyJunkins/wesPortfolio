            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>Since beginning my collegiate career, I have aspired to conduct research in computer science. My areas of
                interest include: Human-Computer Interfacing, Quantum Computing, and Machine Learning.</p>
            <p>I am seeking additional undergraduate research experience and training in order to gain the necessary
                analytical and logical skills needed to produce credible and scholarly research. I am also interested in
                proactively building lasting connections with researchers in computer science.</p>
            <p>As a future Ph.D. student, I seek mentors and possible dissertation committee members/advisors.</p>

            <p>I was also a member of the Beta Club honor society and the Mu Alpha Theta national honor society for
                mathematics.</p>
            <h3>Associate in Science | Shelton State Community college</h3>

            <p>During my time at Shelton, I maintained a 4.0 GPA and was inducted into the Phi Theta Kappa and Psi Beta
                honor societies.</p>
            <p>In addition, I received the Thomas E. Umphrey outstanding freshman award, the excellence in calculus 1
                award, the Norman C. Cephus special achievement award, the Leo Sumner outstanding sophomore award, and
                the Macmillan Learning emerging researcher award.</p>
            <p>I was also a Coca-Cola academic team bronze scholar in Phi Theta Kappa (Top 170 community college
                students in the U.S.), and All-Alabama academic team scholar in 2022.</p>

            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <h3>IT | Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church, Gordo, AL</h3>
            <h4>OCTOBER 2020 - PRESENT</h4>
            <p>As IT director at Mt. Pleasant, I am responsible for managing our <a href="http://mpbcgordo.com"
                    target="_blank">church website</a>, Facebook page, and YouTube channel. I also meet with other staff
                members to resolve all technical issues in the church.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="light">
            <h2>Skills and Strengths</h2>
            <p>I have some experience in research across multiple fields.</p>
            <p>I work well with a team, but I can be productive and resourceful when working alone.</p>
            <p>I have completed research training from Phi Theta Kappa.</p>
            <p>I enjoy working through challenges and issues that are foreign to me.</p>

            <h2>Activities (a closer look)</h2>
            <p>I was inducted into Shelton's chapter of Phi Theta Kappa as an officer. My role was to lead a research
                project with our other officers. After completing a course that trained me to conduct academic research,
                we explored how poor mental health among college students will affect future generations. This
                investigation led to the creation of a mental health awareness fair on campus, where several
                organizations from the Tuscaloosa area set up booths and provided crucial information about their
                services to students and faculty.</p>
            <p>I also worked closely with a psychology professor on campus to build upon my previous research. After
                this, I presented our findings at the Troy University Psychology Conference.</p>
            <p>Since then, I have participated in research with the UA Chemical Engineering department to study the
                synthesis of environmentally friendly glycerol-derived solvents to dissolve ELP waste in water systems.
                I will present my results at the Emerging Researchers National (ERN) Conference.</p>
            <p>Recently, I joined the Brain-Drone Race development team at The University of Alabama. As part of this
                team, we will develop software that provides a smooth interface between the human brain and drones. The
                software development process requires research into human-brain attributes, as well as algorithms to
                compute brain waves.</p>
            <p>I also recently joined the HCI research team of a professor at The University of Alabama. In fact, I
                developed this portfolio while learning Javascript and ThreeJS, which are tools we will use in HCI
                research.</p>
