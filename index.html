            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>Since beginning my collegiate career, I have aspired to conduct research in computer science. My areas of
                interest include: Human-Computer Interaction, Quantum Computing, Operating Systems, and Algorithms.</p>
            <p>I am seeking additional undergraduate research experience and training in order to gain the necessary
                analytical and logical skills needed to produce credible and scholarly research. I am also interested in
                proactively building lasting connections with researchers in computer science.</p>
            <p>As a future Ph.D. student, I seek mentors and possible dissertation committee members/advisors.</p>

                    <p>May, 2021</p>
                    <p>As my first introduction to academic research, this project involved a literature review of previous research that looked at the mental health among college students. We added to this by specifically looking at the mental health among community college students and the effect poor mental health had on future generations. Since college-aged adults are generally the ones who will birth the next generation, looking into the effects of their mental health on their children, and their childrens' children, is a worthwhile pursuit. We surveyed students from multiple community colleges in Alabama attaining information about their mental state, their life choices, their home-life, and much more. We used this data to design an on-campus event dedicated to informing students of the resources available to them (since most students replied that they were unaware of the numerous local resources at their disposal). Many local organizations from the community attended the event distributing crucial material on the resources they provided. A final survey of the event attendies showed that most students were introduced to helpful resources they were previously unaware of. These resources ranged from drug abuse aid, food pantries, mental healthcare providers, and other general community-help centers.</p>

                    <p>I was selected as a summer research intern for the University of Alabama department of Chemical and Biological Engineering. My research advisor had us working on a project that a few of his graduate students were finishing up. I helped in the lab, wrote a white paper at the beginning of the internship, created and made presentations of our progress to faculty, and presented the work at the 2023 Emerging Researchers National Conference. The paper below was written by the graduate students we worked with over the summer. We used this paper to guide us through our summer research project.</p>
