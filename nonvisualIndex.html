            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>Wesley Junkins is a graduate student at The University of Alabama, pursuing a master’s degree in computer
                science. He earned his bachelor’s degree in computer science with a minor in mathematics from the same
                institution in 2024.</p>

            <p>As an undergraduate, Wesley conducted research in the Human-Technology Interaction Lab (HTIL) under the
                mentorship of Dr. Chris Crawford. His work spanned multiple areas of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI),
                including brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), robotics, extended reality (XR), and low-level
                microcontroller
                and network communications. Wesley co-authored several research papers and is contributing to ongoing
                projects in the field. He also assisted in research studies, gained hands-on experience with the IRB
                process, and collaborated closely with graduate researchers.</p>

            <p>Wesley has been recognized for his academic excellence and leadership through induction into several
                prestigious honor societies, including Phi Theta Kappa, Psi Beta, Tau Beta Pi, Tau Sigma, Phi Kappa Phi,
                and
                Upsilon Pi Epsilon. He has received numerous awards and honors that underscore his commitment to
                academic
                and professional growth.</p>

            <p>As he pursues his master’s and future doctoral studies, Wesley aims to deepen his expertise in HCI, BCIs,
                and XR. His ultimate goal is to become a professional researcher in academia or industry, driven by a
                passion for leveraging innovative technologies to address complex technical and societal challenges.</p>
